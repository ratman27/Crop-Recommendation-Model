# ðŸŒ± Crop-Recommendation-Model
This project is a machine learning-based Crop Recommendation System that helps farmers and agricultural experts determine the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions. By leveraging data science and predictive modeling, this system aims to increase agricultural productivity and optimize resource utilization.

# Key Features 
- Predicts the best crop based on soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Provides data-driven insights to assist in sustainable farming practices.

# Importance
Agriculture plays a crucial role in food security and economic stability. Incorrect crop selection can lead to reduced yields and financial losses. This model provides smart, data-driven recommendations to support farmers in making the right choices.
